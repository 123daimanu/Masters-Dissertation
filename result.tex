\section{Anisotropy in the Polar and Azimuthal Angle Distributions}
In order to compare our observed
$\theta$ and $\phi$-distributions with expected isotropic
distribution curves, we have carried out chi-square,
autocorrelation, Fourier (Godlowski 1993), Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(K-S) (Stephens 1970, Press et al. 1992, Kanji 1995) and Kuiper-V
(Kuiper 1962, Stephens 1970) tests. 
These tests are described in the appendix. These tests are a proper method in our
case, because $\theta$ and $\phi$ are independent data. The
significance level is chosen to be 95\%, the null hypothesis is
established to be an equidistribution for the $\theta$ and $\phi$.
As null hypothesis a spatial isotropy of the angular momentum
vector was chosen. In cases of too small sample size only the K-S
and Kuiper-V tests are meaningful. The conditions for anisotropy
are the following: chi-square probability P$(>\chi^2)$ $<$ 0.050,
auto-correlation coefficient (C/C($\sigma$)) and first order
Fourier coefficient ($\Delta_{11}$/$\sigma$($\Delta_{11}$)) $>$ 1
and Fourier probability P($>\Delta_1$) $<$ 0.150, K-S = 1,
Kuiper-V = 1. In the $\theta$-distribution, a positive (negative)
$\Delta_{11}$ suggests that the spin vectors or angular momentum
vectors of galaxies tend to orient parallel (perpendicular) with
respect to the reference coordinate system. In the
$\phi$-distribution, a positive (negative) $\Delta_{11}$ suggests
that the spin vector projections of galaxies tend to point
radially (tangentially) with respect to center of the reference
coordinate system.

\subsection{Abell 1139}
Abell 1139 is surveyed in both SDSS and 2dFGRS, and has largest number of member galaxies in our sample. Hwang and Lee (2007) (herreafter HL) plotted the radial veloctiy and distance and eliminated the non-member galaxies from the clusters.The velocity histogram has gaussian distribution and HL found substrucutres while studying both position and velocity data. This cluster shows single density peak at clusteric center and weak concentration at the substructure. HL measured the $|\frac{v_{rot}}{\sigma_p}|=0.59$ and $\frac{dv}{dR}=464$ and these were above the critical value 0.53 and 380. So, Abell 1139 is possible candidate for rotating cluster. Also the substructure indicate a single cluster in rotation or two overlapping clusters that either merge or depart from each other as pointed in Burgett et al. (2004).

}
\end{figure}
\noindent All the statistical test support isotropy (see Table 5.1)
in both the $\theta$ and $\phi$ distributions suggesting a random orientation of spin vectors and spin vector projections of galaxies with respect to both galactic and Supergalactic coordinate systems. No significant humps and dips can be seen in the histogram. Our result supports the hierarchy model (Peeble 1969) in which galaxies were believed to be first formed and while they obtained angular momentum by tidal forces while they were gathering gravitationally to form clusters.\\\\
Strong isotropy in the spatial orientation of spin vectors of galaxies indicate that a single cluster in rotation rather than two overlapping clusters that either merge or depart from each other as pointed in Burgertt et al. (2004).
\subsection{Abell 2162}
Abell 2162 is one of the nearest cluster in our sample and is a member cluster in the Hercules Supercluser (Einasto et al. 2001). Neither a distinct substructure nor a significant local density peaks is found except for the cluster center. HL calculated rotational amplitude and global velocity gradient using the galaxies at inner region ($<18^\prime$, as the radial distribution was discontinuous at $\sim 18^\prime$) and found ${|v_{rot}|}/{\sigma_p}= 0.64$ and $\frac{dv}{dR}$=635, satisfying the criteria for rotating clusters.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\noindent A hump at $45^\circ$ and two dips at angle $35^\circ$ and $55^\circ$ can be seen in $\theta$ distribution. These humps and dips compensate each other and hence all statistical tests show isotropy (see Table 5.1). The binning effect cannot be ruled out here. Thus, no preferred alignment of spin vectors of galaxies with respect to both galactic and Supergalactic coordinate system is found. In the $\phi$ distribution, all statistical tests advocate isotropy. There is a very good agreement between the observed and expected distribution suggesting random orientation of spin vector projections of galaxies with respect to galactic and Virgo cluster center. Thus there is a good agreement between the hierarchy model and global rotation with the vanishing angular momentum is observed, suggesting the existence of Li model (Li 1998).

\subsection{Abell 2366} Jones \& Forman (1999) and Flin \& Krywult (2006) found no substructure using Einstein X-ray images and positional information of galaxies. Similarly, HL studied galaxy number density map and found no evidence of substructure, but a significant value of velocity dispersion. A weak bimodal velocity distribution with a large dispersion but weak central aggregration of galaxies was found. HL found ${|v_{rot}|}/{\sigma_p}= 0.57$ and $\frac{dv}{dR}$=788, satisfying the criteria for rotating clusters. So, they selected this as a probable rotating galaxy cluster.

\end{figure}

\noindent A significant hump at $25^\circ$ followed by two dips at $35^\circ$ and $65^\circ$ can be seen in the spin vector distribution of member galaxies. These hump and dips compensate each other to show isotropy in the statistical test (see Table 5.1). A local effect can  not be ruled out here, probably due to the gravitational tidal forces due to the massive central region. In azimuthal angle distribution, a random orientation is observed in the statisitics as well as in histogram. Thus, it is found that the rotating cluster which is the dynamical equilibrium shows vanishing angular momentum as predicted by Godlowski et al. (2003) and observationaly verified by Godlwoski (2012).

The region of isotropy is given by the shaded portion in graph.
-$1\leq\Delta_{11}$ /$\sigma(\Delta_{11})\leq +1$ for the isotropy and $\Delta_{11}/\sigma(\Delta_{11}) > \pm 1$ for anisotropy.} 
\end{figure}
\noindent From the Table 5.1 we can easily see that almost all statistical test supports isotropy of the distribution of the spin vectors of galaxy i.e. statistics supports hierarchy model. However, the first order Fourier coefficient test support anisotropy for the azimuthal angle distribution for the A1139 in galactic coordinate system. The polar angle distribution shows strong isotropy in both galactic and Supergalactic system. In case of azimuthal distribution, all the galaxies shows isotropy in Supergalactic coordinate system.\\\\
As the sign of $\Delta_{11}$ for the polar angle distribution gives the tendency of orientation  of spin vectors parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the reference coordinate system. i.e positive (negative) $\Delta_{11}$ suggests that spin vectors of galaxies tend to orient parallel (perpendicular) with respect to reference coordinate sysem. From figure 5.4 we can see angular momentum vectors of A1139 and A2366 tend to orient perpendicular to the reference plane of the galactic coordinate system but A2162 has the spin vector orientation parallel to the reference plane of the galactic coordinage system. However in case of Supergalactic coordinate system A2162 and A2366 tend to orient its angular momentum vector parallel to the plane but A1139 tend to orient it perpendicular to the plane of Supergalactic coordinate system.\\\\
The database, selection criteria, result and references of the published paper in MNRAS based on result of these three clusters (A1139, A2162, A2366) along with the result of other three clusters (A0954, A1399, A2169), which was proposed by HL as rotating clusters, is given in tabular form below:
